## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of marketing, understanding customer behavior is key. This repository equips you with tools to predict customer responses to telemarketing campaigns using a diverse set of machine learning and regression models. By leveraging the power of data analysis, we empower you to make data-driven decisions for your campaigns.

## Dataset

We've used the "bank-full.csv" dataset, sourced from the world of bank telemarketing, as our playground. This dataset is rich in features and insights, making it an ideal choice for predictive analysis.

- **bank-full.csv**: The original dataset
- **bank_cleaned.csv**: The cleaned and preprocessed version of the dataset

## Data Cleaning

Data is the heart of predictive analytics. We've put considerable effort into cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure accurate results. Our "bank_cleaned.csv" is your ticket to hassle-free analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Understanding the nuances of your data is crucial. Our extensive exploratory data analysis provides you with valuable insights into customer behaviors, trends, and patterns.

## Classification Models

We've deployed a range of classification models, including:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Multi-layer Perceptron (Neural Network)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

These models are designed to predict customer responses and help you tailor your telemarketing campaigns effectively.

## Regression Models

For regression tasks, we've included:

- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Elastic Net
- K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor

These models assist in forecasting numerical outcomes, providing you with valuable insights for campaign optimization.
